A user defined function is small program written by the user to perform operations within SQL statements. 
These operations tend to be easy to perform using another language and difficult to perform using SQL.

The benefits of UDFs are their use in many different places when compared to SQL stored procedures, such as using 
UDFs’ table features to break up complex code into shorter code blocks. UDFs also allow users to pass in parameters 
into database objects, as well as allowing users to return values that are based on any scalar values in the database.

Queries are database operations that retrieve information. These operations are usually written in a query language, 
such as SQL, XQuery, and DMX.

Stored Procedures are subroutines stored in the database catalog that allow the users to write procedures in simple, 
general-purpose languages. These procedures can then be used in queries to perform computations that cannot be performed 
in the query language alone.

The difference between UDFs and stored procedures are minimal.

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object relational database management system. It supports a majority of the SQL standard 
and offers complex queries, foreign keys, and transactional integrity, among other features. It can also be extended 
through features such as data types, functions, and procedural languages.

PostgreSQL traces its roots from the POSTGRES package made at the University of California at Berkeley. This software 
was first used in 1986, and was implemented in production and research applications, such as a medical information 
database, an asteroid tracking database, and a financial data analysis system.

While POSTGRES usage doubled in 1993, it also became a burden to Berkeley because of the large amounts of time Berkeley 
devoted to maintenance and support. In 1994, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen made some improvements to POSTGRES, including 
adding a SQL language interpreter, trimming the source code size by 25%, and improving performance and maintainability. 
This new version was called Postgres95 and was released as open-source code.

In 1996, Postgres95 shifted its focus from fixing bugs in the server code to augmenting its features and capabilities 
(while still making improvements in all areas). Postgres95 was also renamed as PostgreSQL to show connection between 
Berkeley’s POSTGRES project and the latest versions with SQL.

PostgreSQL has four types of functions:
1. SQL functions
2. Procedural language UDFs
3. Internal functions written in C (PostgreSQL’s source code language)
4. C language UDFs
